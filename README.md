A fully functional blog platform built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), emphasizing seamless user experience and robust backend integration. 

#### **Frontend (React.js):**
- Developed reusable and modular components for efficient UI/UX design.
- Utilized **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`) for state and lifecycle management.
- Integrated **Context API** for global state management, handling user roles and authentication.
- Implemented **React Router** for dynamic routing and role-specific paths (reader vs. author).
- Features:
  - Separate registration forms for **reader** and **author**.
  - **Dashboard/Admin Panel** for authors to perform CRUD operations on blogs.
  - Category filtering for blogs (sports, tech, business, etc.).
  - Responsive design using modern CSS frameworks.

#### **Backend (Node.js & Express.js):**
- Designed RESTful APIs for user authentication, blog CRUD operations, and category filtering.
- Implemented JWT-based authentication and authorization to secure API endpoints.
- Integrated with **MongoDB** for efficient storage and retrieval of user and blog data.

2) Perform npm install in both backend and frontend folder seperately
